          <p><strong>Shipping Risks & DOA (Dead on Arrival) Policy</strong></p>
          <p>
            While we take every precaution to ensure safe delivery, shipping live fish always carries some risk. Please review our <strong>DOA guarantee conditions</strong> carefully:
          </p>
          <ul className="policy-list">
            <li><strong>DOA Policy Applies to U.S. Orders Only.</strong> International DOA policies are handled on a case-by-case basis.</li>
            <li><strong>DOA is still guaranteed</strong> even in cases of shipping delays caused by severe weather or courier-related issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p><strong>DOA Credit Conditions</strong></p>
          <ul className="policy-list">
            <li>If a fish arrives DOA, a <strong>credit will be issued</strong> toward a future order.</li>
            <li><strong>Shipping costs are non-refundable.</strong></li>
            <li>If your package is delayed by the courier, you <strong>may be eligible for free shipping credit</strong> toward a future order, but you must contact us to confirm eligibility.</li>
            <li>Clear <strong>photos of the DOA in its original packaging</strong> must be emailed to <strong>iaquaaquatics@gmail.com</strong> within <strong>3 hours of delivery</strong>.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to take a DOA photo is to <strong>float the bag in your tank</strong> and take a clear picture.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
