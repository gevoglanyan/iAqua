            By placing an order with <strong>iAqua Aquatics</strong>, the customer acknowledges and agrees to the following terms:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul className="disclaimer-list">
            <li><strong>Risk of Live Animal Shipping:</strong> While we take every precaution to ensure the safe arrival of your livestock, shipping live animals inherently carries risks.</li>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee on Survival After Delivery:</strong> Once the fish is placed in your tank, we cannot be responsible for their survival due to differences in customer tank conditions, water quality, diet, or acclimation process.</li>
            <li><strong>No Refunds for Shipping Delays:</strong> Shipping delays caused by the courier are beyond our control. We do not issue refunds for shipping costs under any circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>No Responsibility for Incorrect Addresses:</strong> Customers are fully responsible for ensuring that the shipping address provided is accurate. Incorrect addresses or failed delivery attempts will void any guarantees.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Sales on All Livestock:</strong> All sales are final once the fish has been shipped. We do not accept returns or exchanges on live animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Responsibility for Acclimation:</strong> Customers must follow proper acclimation procedures upon receiving their fish. Failure to follow these steps may lead to stress or loss of livestock.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
