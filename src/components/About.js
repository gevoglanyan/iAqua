          <br />
          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>iAqua Aquatics</strong>, your premier source for high-quality freshwater fish.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With over <strong>20 years of experience</strong> in the aquatics hobby, our team is passionate about providing healthy, vibrant fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            We maintain strict quarantine protocols and only ship fish that we would be proud to keep in our own tanks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Unlike big box stores, we hand-select our fish from trusted breeders and importers, ensuring you receive the healthiest specimens possible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At <strong>iAqua Aquatics</strong>, we believe in building relationships with our customers. We're always available to provide advice on care, compatibility, and setup.
